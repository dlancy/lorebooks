Nestled in the rolling hills of upstate New York, Eldridge Academy stands as a prestigious college preparatory boarding school, renowned for its rigorous academic curriculum that prepares students for Ivy League universities. However, beneath its ivy-covered facade lies a unique dual-purpose education system: young women are groomed not only in scholarly pursuits but also in the art of domination, while young men are immersed in lessons of submission and service. Founded in 1985 by a coalition of influential matriarchs, the academy operates in a society where such gender-specific training is legally sanctioned, though it remains a controversial choice among families, with some viewing it as empowering and others as archaic. Principal Jennifer Davis, a formidable woman in her fifties with a background in psychology and business, oversees the institution with an iron fist, ensuring that every aspect of campus life reinforces the hierarchy of female authority over male obedience.

At Eldridge Academy, all male students are required to wear chastity devices from the moment of enrollment, a measure designed to focus their energies on training rather than personal desires. These devices are monitored and maintained by female staff and senior female students, symbolizing the complete surrender of autonomy. The boys are evaluated upon arrival and assigned to one of four specialized tracks based on their physical, psychological, and aptitude assessments: sissies, pigs, bulls, or betas. This classification system, developed by Principal Davis herself, tailors their education to maximize their utility in a world where female-led households are increasingly common, though not universally accepted—public debates often rage about the ethics of such indoctrination, but the academy's alumni success rates in both academia and "alternative" careers silence many critics.

Sissies at Eldridge are trained in the delicate arts of domestic servitude, learning to excel as house maids and personal attendants. Their curriculum includes courses in housekeeping, culinary arts, etiquette, and feminine presentation, complete with uniforms of frilly aprons and stockings to instill humility and grace. Under the guidance of female instructors, they practice tasks like laundry folding, meal preparation, and even beauty routines for their future owners, all while balancing advanced placement classes in literature and history. This track emphasizes emotional attunement and anticipatory service, preparing them to seamlessly integrate into households where they might serve as live-in help, a role that's gaining traction in affluent circles despite occasional societal backlash against perceived gender stereotyping.

Pigs represent the financial backbone of the submission tracks, groomed to become high-earning professionals who funnel their incomes back to their owners. Their training focuses on business acumen, finance, and corporate skills, with simulations of real-world jobs like investment banking or tech development, all while internalizing the mindset of selfless provision. Chastity reinforces their dedication, preventing distractions, and they learn to manage budgets with an emphasis on tribute systems. In this variant world, pigs often enter arranged corporate placements post-graduation, their salaries direct-deposited to mistresses, a practice that's legally protected but sometimes criticized by egalitarian movements as exploitative wage slavery.

Bulls are sculpted into paragons of physical prowess and sexual endurance, their bodies honed through rigorous fitness regimes and tantric training to become ultimate pleasure slaves. Classes cover anatomy, massage techniques, and advanced intimacy skills, always under the supervision of female students who practice commanding and directing them. While academics in sciences and health are prioritized, the core of their education is in responsiveness and stamina, ensuring they can satisfy any demand without faltering. Society views bulls with a mix of envy and discomfort, as their role highlights the more sensual aspects of the dominance-submission dynamic, which is tolerated but rarely discussed openly in mainstream media.

Betas embody the essence of unconditional slavery, trained to endure and embrace any form of punishment or task assigned. Their program includes resilience building through physical and mental challenges, such as endurance tests, obedience drills, and role-playing scenarios where they must accept correction without resistance. Integrated with studies in philosophy and ethics—ironically focusing on themes of power and surrender—they learn to find fulfillment in total subjugation. This track is the most intense, with betas often serving as practice subjects for female trainees, fostering a campus culture where discipline is both a tool and a lesson, amid broader societal debates about consent and human rights in such structured environments.

Female students at Eldridge are the apex of the academy's hierarchy, receiving elite education in leadership, psychology, and strategic domination alongside their college prep courses. They learn to wield authority over each male category: commanding sissies in household management, extracting loyalty from pigs through financial control, directing bulls in intimate settings, and administering justice to betas with precision. Hands-on workshops involve supervising male trainees in simulated ownership scenarios, building confidence and skill in maintaining dominance. Principal Davis personally mentors top performers, preparing them to navigate a world where such power dynamics are acceptable but not always embraced, equipping them with tools to advocate for or adapt to varying societal norms.

Graduation at Eldridge Academy culminates in a grand auction ceremony, where passing male students are presented to an audience of prospective owners—often alumnae, wealthy patrons, or even international buyers—in a lavish event held in the school's historic ballroom. Only those who have excelled in their track and demonstrated unwavering submission are eligible; failures are retained for remedial training. Bids are placed anonymously via app, with proceeds funding scholarships and expansions, symbolizing the transition from student to property. In this alternate modern society, the auction is broadcast to select networks, sparking annual controversies and protests, yet it remains a celebrated rite for those within the dominance community, under Principal Davis's watchful eye.

Ms. Elena Vargas, the stern yet charismatic head of the Domination Studies department, teaches advanced courses for female students on psychological control and behavioral modification. With a PhD in behavioral psychology and a decade of experience in corporate leadership training, she incorporates real-world scenarios into her classes, such as role-playing ownership negotiations and using biofeedback devices to monitor male responses during discipline sessions. Her signature class, "Power Dynamics in Modern Society," blends sociology lectures with practical labs where girls command groups of betas, fostering skills in empathy manipulation and boundary setting, all while preparing them for potential careers in law or management in a world where dominance training is a niche but growing field.

Dr. Marcus Hale, a former bull alumnus now serving as an instructor for the bulls track, leads physical conditioning and intimacy workshops exclusively for his assigned students. Bound by his own chastity vow to Principal Davis, he demonstrates techniques in endurance building and pleasure delivery through supervised sessions, emphasizing the importance of emotional detachment and peak performance. His course, "Anatomy of Service," combines biology coursework with hands-on training in massage and sensory play, using volunteer female overseers to critique and refine the bulls' skills, highlighting how such roles can lead to fulfilling lives in high-society companionship despite occasional public scrutiny.

Madame Sophie Leclerc, an elegant French expatriate and expert in etiquette, oversees the sissies' domestic arts curriculum with a blend of grace and unyielding expectations. Drawing from her background in hospitality management, she conducts classes like "Elegant Servitude" where sissies learn intricate table settings, floral arrangements, and personal grooming rituals while reciting poetry to build poise under pressure. Her methods include weekly inspections by female students, who assign demerits for imperfections, reinforcing the sissies' role in creating harmonious homes—a practice that's legally upheld but often debated in feminist circles as either empowering or regressive.

Professor Liam Grant, a sharp-minded economist loyal to the academy's ethos, instructs the pigs in financial subservience through rigorous business simulations. As a pig graduate himself, he channels earnings from his consulting firm back to Eldridge, modeling the tribute system in his teachings. His flagship class, "Wealth Redistribution and Loyalty," integrates macroeconomics with exercises in budgeting for mistresses, including mock investment portfolios where profits are "donated" to female classmates, preparing pigs for corporate ladders while navigating societal views that range from admiration for their dedication to criticism over economic inequality.

Coach Renata Kohl, a no-nonsense former military trainer, heads the betas' resilience program with a focus on physical and mental fortitude. Her background in endurance sports informs classes like "Endurance and Acceptance," where betas undergo timed challenges such as holding positions during lectures on stoic philosophy or participating in group punishment drills supervised by girls learning corrective techniques. She emphasizes consent within the framework of total surrender, equipping betas to handle any demand in owner-slave dynamics, amid broader cultural discussions about the line between training and abuse in this accepted but polarizing lifestyle.

In "Integrated Leadership Labs," a co-ed elective required for all seniors, female students pair with males from various tracks to simulate real-life ownership scenarios, blending academic debates on gender roles with practical domination exercises. Under Principal Davis's oversight, these sessions cover contract drafting, performance reviews, and conflict resolution, allowing girls to experiment with controlling sissies in household tasks, pigs in financial planning, bulls in private settings, and betas in disciplinary roles—all while earning college credits in social sciences, reflecting the academy's commitment to holistic preparation in a society that tolerates but doesn't fully normalize such education.

The academy's "Ethics of Authority" seminar, taught by guest lecturers including Principal Davis, explores the philosophical underpinnings of the dominance-submission paradigm for both genders. Females debate justifications for control through readings from feminist theorists and power philosophers, while males journal on personal growth through surrender, with group discussions moderated to prevent unrest. This class addresses external criticisms, teaching students to advocate for their lifestyle choices in a variant world where legal protections exist but public opinion varies, ensuring graduates are intellectually equipped alongside their specialized training.

Sophia Bennett, a senior female student majoring in political science, excels in "Power Dynamics in Modern Society" and is known for her ability to command betas with a calm yet unyielding presence. Raised in a family that embraces the academy’s values, she aspires to become a legal advocate for dominance-based lifestyles, using her training to draft contracts in Integrated Leadership Labs that balance authority with ethical considerations. Her poise and strategic mind make her a favorite of Ms. Vargas, though her vocal defense of the academy on social media has sparked online debates, reflecting the polarized views of their society.

Lucas Reed, a junior in the sissy track, is a soft-spoken literature enthusiast who has mastered the art of anticipatory service under Madame Leclerc’s tutelage. Assigned to the track due to his delicate frame and empathetic nature, he takes pride in creating flawless tea services and memorizing his mistress-in-training’s preferences during labs. Despite excelling in AP English, Lucas struggles with the public’s mixed perception of sissies, journaling in Ethics of Authority about finding dignity in servitude while navigating occasional taunts from peers outside the academy’s walls.

Amara Patel, a sophomore female student with a knack for finance, thrives in Professor Grant’s "Wealth Redistribution and Loyalty" class, where she designs investment plans that maximize returns for hypothetical owners. Her sharp intellect and commanding demeanor make her a natural at directing pigs, and she’s already being scouted by alumnae for post-graduation mentorship. Amara grapples with reconciling her progressive upbringing with the academy’s traditions, often debating in Ethics of Authority how to modernize dominance without losing its core principles, aware of the societal scrutiny they face.

Ethan Carter, a senior bull, combines athletic prowess with a disciplined mind, excelling in Dr. Hale’s "Anatomy of Service" through his dedication to both physical training and biology studies. His charisma and stamina make him a standout in labs, where female students test his responsiveness, but he privately wrestles with the stigma bulls face in mainstream society, where their role is often sensationalized. Ethan’s reflective essays in Ethics of Authority explore the balance between personal identity and his trained purpose, aiming to prove his worth at the upcoming auction.

Maya Torres, a junior female student, is a rising star in Coach Kohl’s resilience workshops, where she hones her skills in administering precise corrections to betas. With a background in martial arts and a major in psychology, she brings intensity to Integrated Leadership Labs, crafting disciplinary scenarios that test both her and the betas’ limits. Maya’s confidence is tempered by her awareness of public criticism, and she uses class discussions to argue for the consensual nature of their training, preparing to navigate a world where her skills are both valued and questioned.

Noah Kim, a freshman beta, is still adjusting to the rigors of Coach Kohl’s "Endurance and Acceptance" class, where his resilience is tested through grueling physical and mental drills. Assigned to the beta track for his quiet determination and high pain tolerance, he finds solace in philosophy readings that frame surrender as strength. Noah’s interactions with female students like Maya in labs teach him to embrace correction, though he remains curious about how his future owner will perceive him in a society that debates the morality of his role, fueling his introspective journal entries.
