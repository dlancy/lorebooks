In the year 2247, a mysterious plague decimated the male population, leaving only 1 man for every 100 women.

The global gender ratio imbalance made male semen a rare and priceless commodity, traded on black markets for astronomical sums.

Governments collapsed, and matriarchal societies rose, restructuring civilization around the control of male reproduction.

Men are now classified as "protected assets" and confined to heavily guarded Semen Farms.

Each farm houses 50-200 men, kept in sterile, climate-controlled pens to optimize semen production.

Men are fed a nutrient-rich diet laced with aphrodisiac drugs to maintain constant sexual arousal.

Chastity devices, made of unbreakable polycarbon, are mandatory to prevent unauthorized semen release.

Semen extraction occurs thrice daily via automated suction machines, designed to maximize yield without physical harm.

Extracted semen is cryogenically stored and distributed to fertility banks for artificial insemination programs.

Farm overseers, exclusively women, undergo rigorous training to manage male behavior and ensure compliance.

Men are assigned identification numbers, stripped of names to reinforce their status as resources.

Aphrodisiac drugs cause intense psychological dependency, making men crave the milking process.

Rebellious men are subjected to neural reconditioning, erasing dissent and enforcing docility.

Semen quality is graded on a scale from A to F, with A-grade fetching the highest prices.

Elite women, known as Matrons, control the global semen trade and wield unparalleled political power.

Pregnancy rates are tightly regulated to maintain the gender imbalance and preserve semen value.

Male children are separated at birth and raised in isolated academies until they reach reproductive age.

Farms compete to produce the highest-quality semen, with top farms earning Matron Council subsidies.

Unauthorized contact between men and women outside farms is punishable by life imprisonment.

The Matron Council enforces a global ban on male sexual autonomy, citing resource scarcity.

Religious cults worship semen as a divine elixir, believing it holds the key to humanity’s survival.

Black-market semen smuggling is a capital offense, with drones patrolling farm perimeters to deter thieves.

Men over 40 are retired from milking and repurposed as laborers or euthanized if deemed unproductive.

The average male lifespan on farms is 35 years due to the physical toll of constant milking.

Synthetic semen research is outlawed, as it threatens the Matron Council’s economic control.

Rumors persist of an underground male resistance, hiding in wastelands beyond the farms’ reach.
