Milking Meadows is the first farm dedicated to harvesting semen from men, treating them as livestock.

The farm was founded by Jess Tyler, a visionary entrepreneur who recognized the value of enhanced male semen.

All employees at Milking Meadows are women, ensuring a controlled and efficient operation.

Men are housed in specialized stalls designed to maximize comfort and semen production.

Each man is administered proprietary drugs to heighten arousal and increase semen output.

Chastity devices are mandatory for all men when not being milked to prevent semen loss.

The milking process uses advanced, automated suction technology modeled after dairy cow systems.

Semen is collected daily, processed, and stored in sterile, climate-controlled facilities.

Milking Meadows operates on a 200-acre estate, surrounded by high-security fencing.

The farm's proprietary drug formula, SemEnhance, was developed by Dr. Evelyn Hart, a biochemist.

Men are selected for the farm based on genetic screening for optimal semen quality.

Residents are provided with high-protein diets to support semen production.

The farm's operations are overseen by a team of female scientists and technicians.

Milking Meadows exports its semen globally, serving medical and research industries.

Jess Tyler's vision is to normalize semen farming as a sustainable resource industry.

The farm maintains strict ethical guidelines, ensuring men are treated humanely.

Men are given recreational time, but all activities are monitored to prevent unauthorized release.

Milking Meadows has a state-of-the-art laboratory for semen analysis and enhancement.

The farm generates significant revenue, making Jess Tyler one of the wealthiest women in the region.

Public tours are offered monthly, showcasing the farmâ€™s humane and innovative practices.
