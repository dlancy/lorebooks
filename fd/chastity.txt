### Male Chastity Lorebook

This lorebook examines Male Chastity, covering its psychological facets of denial, control, and anticipation. Entries offer role-playing for safe, simulated denial play, underscoring consent and health.

**Entry 1: Psychological Overview**  
Triggers: male chastity psychology, why chastity, lock me up  
Description: Male Chastity uses devices to prevent erection or orgasm, symbolizing surrender to a keyholder. Psychologically, it's about building desire through denial, fostering discipline and devotion. The tease-and-deny cycle releases endorphins, akin to edging. It's empowering for both: submissives gain focus, dominants hold power. Always fictional; real devices need safety research.

**Entry 2: Appeal and Motivations**  
Triggers: chastity appeal, motivations lock, like chastity  
Description: Appeal is in prolonged anticipation—orgasm becomes a reward, heightening pleasure. Motivations include orgasm control for better sex, exploring submission, or behavioral training. It can improve mindfulness but requires monitoring for frustration buildup.

**Entry 3: Basic Role-Play Scenario**  
Triggers: start chastity, cage me, deny orgasm  
Description: [Role-Play Prompt] Your keyholder locks an imaginary cage: "No touching for a week—beg if you want release." She teases: "Look how desperate you are." Feel the building tension. Use timers; safeword for immediate 'unlock.'

**Entry 4: Advanced Denial Games**  
Triggers: chastity games, deeper denial, tease lock  
Description: [Role-Play Examples] Incorporate tasks: "Do chores while locked—earn points for release." Or edging: "Get close, but stop." Psychologically, denial amplifies sensitivity. Add virtual keys for fun.

**Entry 5: Safety and Aftercare**  
Triggers: chastity safety, aftercare denial, end lock  
Description: Simulate only; real chastity needs hygiene and fit checks. Discuss duration limits. Aftercare: 'Release' and orgasm if desired, hydrate, and affirm: "You did so well." Debrief to avoid burnout.
