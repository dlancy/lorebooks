This psychological manipulation can manifest through a variety of tactics, frequently employing ongoing denial, misdirection, or misleading information. The perpetrator may persistently deny events that have occurred, dismiss the target's feelings as irrational, or provide false narratives that create confusion. Over time, this relentless distortion of reality can erode the target's confidence in their own thoughts and experiences, leading them to increasingly doubt their grasp on what is true and real. Ultimately, such tactics serve to undermine the victim's sense of self and can have profound effects on their mental well-being.","constant":true,"selective":true,"selectiveLogic":0,"order":10,"position":0,"disable":false,"addMemo":true,"excludeRecursion":true,"probability":100,"displayIndex":1,"useProbability":true,"secondary_keys":[],"keys":["reality","contradict","deny","confusion","Gaslighting","doubt","memory","sanity","lie","lying"],"id":1,"priority":10,"insertion_order":10,"enabled":true,"name":"Gaslighting","extensions":{"depth":4,"weight":10,"addMemo":true,"probability":100,"displayIndex":1,"selectiveLogic":0,"useProbability":true,"characterFilter":null,"excludeRecursion":true},"case_sensitive":false,"depth":4,"characterFilter":null},"2":{"uid":2,"key":["affection","infatuation","gifts","Love Bombing","attention","praise","clingy","overwhelm","obsession"],"keysecondary":[],"comment":"Love Bombing","content":"Love Bombing is overwhelming a target with excessive affection, praise, or attention to create dependency, lower defenses, or obscure ulterior motives.","constant":true,"selective":true,"selectiveLogic":0,"order":10,"position":0,"disable":false,"addMemo":true,"excludeRecursion":true,"probability":100,"displayIndex":1,"useProbability":true,"secondary_keys":[],"keys":["affection","infatuation","gifts","Love Bombing","attention","praise","clingy","overwhelm","obsession"],"id":2,"priority":10,"insertion_order":10,"enabled":true,"name":"Love Bombing","extensions":{"depth":4,"weight":10,"addMemo":true,"probability":100,"displayIndex":1,"selectiveLogic":0,"useProbability":true,"characterFilter":null,"excludeRecursion":true},"case_sensitive":false,"depth":4,"characterFilter":null},"3":{"uid":3,"key":["Guilt-Tripping","shame","responsible","burden","sacrifice","guilt","duty","obligation","owe"],"keysecondary":[],"comment":"Guilt-Tripping","content":"The \"Guilt-Tripping\" method takes advantage of the target's feelings of duty or compassion by presenting requests or demands in a way that suggests fulfilling them is essential to relieve the manipulator's pain or dissatisfaction. This technique often involves the manipulator expressing their emotional distress or disappointment in a manner that evokes sympathy and a sense of responsibility in the target. Through this approach, the manipulator skillfully frames their needs as paramount, creating an emotional burden for the target, who may feel compelled to comply in order to alleviate the perceived suffering of the manipulator. This dynamic can lead to a cycle of guilt and obligation, where the target feels increasingly responsible for the emotional state of the manipulator, further reinforcing the manipulative
